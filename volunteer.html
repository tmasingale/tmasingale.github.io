      Volunteering as a coach for the Spokane Mayor’s Cup event is easy. The obligation is for the day of the event only. The primary duty of coaches at our event is to act as a helper and a role model for teams.  The coaches are given a guide to help them to help participants.  You will be assigned one or more teams.  The true benefit of having industry representatives as coaches is to introduce participants to people do cybersecurity related things as part of their professional lives.  The technical challenges may not be areas in which you may not be familiar.  We have some guides and clues that you can share with participants.  You can’t help them directly, but you can give them advice or just chat with them about what you do at work.  This is a learning event.  Help us to introduce college and high school students to the professional world of cybersecurity.

      The event is Saturday February 12, 2022.  It runs from 8:30 to 5:30. You do not need to attend the whole day.  Lunch and refreshments will be provided.  To volunteer email ssteiner@ewu.edu
